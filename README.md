# WebSecureScout

Welcome to our project WebSecureScout! This project is a research in the field of cyber security that collects data from websites, such as has_https, host_ip_address, protocol_version_name, forced_redirect_to_https, https_redirect_to_same_domain, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, certificate_valid, certificate_version, issuer, subject, certificate_algorithm_name, key_size, certificate_public_key_type, start_certificate_validate, certificate_expiration, ssl2, ssl3, tls1_0, tls1_1, tls1_2, tls1_3, is_vulnerable_to_heartblee, is_vulnerable_to_ccs_injection, is_vulnerable_to_client_renegotiation_dos, supports_secure_renegotiation, supports_tls_compression, robot_attack, errors, dnssec_domain, dnssec_nameserver, has_dnssec, dnssec_is_valid, dnssec_algorithm.

This project consists of a set of tools designed to scan the security of websites and detect any potential vulnerabilities that could compromise the security of the website. The results of the scan will be used to generate a report with the security status of the website.

We invite you to join our project and help us improve the security of websites by contributing to our code, reporting issues and suggesting improvements.

Thank you for your interest and support!
